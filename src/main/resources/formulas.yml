# This file contains the base of how HP is calculated
# The default value to use for a health *variable* if the value is not present, and only if it is the last case available.
# (i.e: player has no specific health permissions, then the %permission% variable is set to this value)
default if not present:
  world: 1
# in the rest of the worlds, not specified above
default for all worlds: 0
#TODO: add global to list of worlds in formula edit GUI
# Default list of formulas to use when a player is in a world that is not specified below
global formulas:
  - 'base+permission+group+shop'
  - 'base+shop'
  - 'base/2'
# Formulas are made up of a list of cases that are to be executed in order
# each case is a formula composed of base HP (%base%), permission given HP (%permission%),
# group based HP (%group%) and bought/sold HP (%shop%)
formulas per world:
  world:
    - 'permission+shop'
    - 'base+shop'
  # Infinite cases are allowed.
  # If a case is composed of 2 optional variables, each count for the variable validity.
  # In this case for the 2nd case (%permission%+%shop%) if either permission or shops
  # is not present, the 3rd case (%base%+%shop%) will be used. If shop is the variable that is not present,
  # the "default if not present" value will be used for the shop variable
