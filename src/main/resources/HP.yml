# HP values stored here
# HP checking priorities: 1- by name (if the players name is under players, that value will be used)
# 2- by permission (if player has any permission with the "healthpower.amount.NUMBER" format, that value will be used)
# 3- by group (if a player's primary group is under the groups list in this file, the value for that group will be used)
# 4- default (if none of the above apply for a player, this default value will be used).
# Set default to 0 or any negative number to not use a default value and not modify players' hp when any other methods
# apply to them.
